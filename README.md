**ClippyAI**
================

**Overview**

ClippyAI is an innovative productivity tool that revolutionizes the way you interact with your computer. This
application takes notes from your clipboard and sends them along with a task to Ollama, a popular local AI service.
After being processed, the response will be available in the clipboard and can be pasted into any application the user is using.

**Features**

* **Highest Level of Data Privacy**: Your data stays your data and nothing leaves your PC. After installation, you can
even use this tool completely offline.
* **Clipboard Integration**: ClippyAI seamlessly integrates with your system's clipboard, capturing text instantly
after it is copied or cut. The clipboard's content can then be sent along with a task to the Ollama API. After execution, the output will be available in the clipboard, too.
* **Super Fast Response Times**: Thanks to the integration of a PostgreSql vector database, your favorite generated outputs can be saved as templates. The usage of an embedding LLM enables ClippyAI to find the best template for your input. If no suitable template answer for your task is found, the output will be generated by the LLM in the classical way.  
* **Desktop Notifications**: System notifications inform the user about the task status.
* **Cross-Platform Support**: Developed with .NET and Avalonia, ClippyAI runs on Windows and Linux (X11), ensuring that users can enjoy its benefits regardless of their platform. Hotkeys allow the user to use ClippyAI easily, without interacting with the user interface.

**Example Use Cases**

* Copy an email and let ClippyAI write the response
* Copy some code from an IDE and let ClippyAI find an error
* Explain a complicated text to understand it better
* Translate a text into another language
* Summarize a long text in a few sentences

**Getting Started**

1. Install Ollama from [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download).
2. Set the environment variable OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 and restart the Ollama application.
3. Download the latest release of ClippyAI for your OS (Windows or Linux).
4. Run `setup.exe` on Windows or install the .deb/.rpm packages on Linux/X11 systems.
5. Install PostgreSql and pgai.
    1. Install the PostgreSql webserver and the pgai packages. See [https://github.com/timescale/pgai](https://github.com/timescale/pgai) for installation instructions. 4.1
    2. If you are a Docker user, clone or download this repository and execute `docker-compose up` from the `ClippyAI/Docker` directory to install PostgreSql with pgai as a container.
    3. Optionally, you can also use a cloud based PostgreSql database from Timescale.
6. Edit the PostgreSql connection string of the ClippyAI.conf file to enter the server address and user credentials.
7. Run `ClippyAI` from the start menu of your OS and click on the tray icon to open it.
8. Click on `Options`, the `Pull` button and enter `gemma2` to let ClippyAI download and install the Google Gemma2 AI model to your local PC. Please be patient, as the downloading can take a few minutes, depending on how fast your internet connection is.
9. Do the same again with the `nomic-embed-text` model, which will be used for embeddings.

**Using ClippyAI**

1. Choose the task from the dropdown list.
2. Copy or cut some text from an application (e.g., email, chat, or document) via [Ctrl]+[C].
3. Click `Send` or use the keyboard shortcut [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[C] to send the clipboard contents with the task to the local LLM.
4. Review or paste ([Ctrl]+[V]) your generated task in the application where you need it.
